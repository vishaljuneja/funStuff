/*
 * peer 3 â†’ Code is well-structured and design makes sense: 
 * The exceptions InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e do stop the execution of the whole 
 * thread which is bad Concurrency controls are used correctly: 
 * Your program uses way to much resources (busy-waiting). 
 * You should not do ping.isAlive() but ping.join() because then you are not wasting resources 
 * with the empty {} in the wile loop Also the if(flag.intValue() == 1) in the while loop wastes resources 
 * because both threads loops are running all the time only doing sometimes some work -> if you use 
 * any of the proposed mechanisms your threads are not burning CPU resources while waiting 
 * The cyclicbarrier is useless here. 
 * The code does also work without it and its purpose is to wait for example until other threads finished 
 * their calculations (wait for dependencies!). 
 * Code demonstrates the appropriate level of readability for others to understand the intent and 
 * execution of the program: should have some comments as your use of concurrency mechanisms is quite 
 * strange
