/**
 * This is a EchoServerHSHA which uses a Reactor pattern to accept new
 * connections and to handle read/write operations with the clients connected.
 * If it has a new incoming connection, it uses the Acceptor of the
 * Acceptor-Connector pattern to create the client connection. It also creates
 * an Wrapper pattern object of type EchoServerHandler which handles all future
 * read/write operations on the connection.
 * 
 * The Server uses Half-Sync/Half-ASync pattern. Accepting client connection,
 * and socket read/write operations are done in the Half-ASync part. The input
 * message is put into a queue for the Half-Sync part to process and put the
 * result back in a queue for writing response back to client.
 * 
 * Usage "java EchoServerHSHA portNumber". Where portNumber is an integer less
 * than 65536.
 * 
 * Implementation ideas picked from links provided in the forums.
